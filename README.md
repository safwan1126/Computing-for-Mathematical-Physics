# Computing-for-Mathematical-Physics
We used Mathematica, a functional language, to complete a broad range of tasks including data analysis, graphing, equation solving and simulations. 
Mathematica is particularly powerful in its ability to solve complex differential equations and integrals numerically, providing us with an estimate of an otherwise
impossible-to-solve equation. Its built-in functions which are common in physics allow us to more easily perform calculations and create graphs which would 
have otherwise been very tedious to solve on a traditional programming language such as Python.
